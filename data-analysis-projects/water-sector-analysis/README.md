# Water Sector Analysis

An in-depth data analysis of water access patterns, quality metrics, and infrastructure investment across African countries (2020-2024).

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes water sector data to understand:
- Urban vs Rural water access disparities
- Infrastructure investment impact on access rates
- Water quality trends by region
- Country-level improvement trajectories

## 🔍 Key Findings

1. **Urban-Rural Gap**: Nigeria shows the largest gap (34.9%), while South Africa has the smallest (13.5%)
2. **Top Performer**: Rwanda leads in access improvement despite lower investment
3. **Investment Correlation**: Positive correlation (r ≈ 0.45) between infrastructure spending and access rates
4. **Regional Quality**: Southern Africa leads in water quality metrics
